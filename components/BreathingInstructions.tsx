        <p className="mb-4"> Belly breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, is a powerful technique that can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and improve overall well-being. This type of breathing engages the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs, which is designed to do most of the work of breathing.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How to Practice Belly Breathing:</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down.</li>
          <li>Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.</li>
          <li>Breathe in slowly through your nose, feeling your belly expand. The hand on your chest should remain relatively still.</li>
          <li>Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your belly fall.</li>
          <li>Repeat this process, focusing on the movement of your belly rather than your chest.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For beginners, it&apos;s recommended to practice for 5-10 minutes at a time, 3-4 times per day. As you become more comfortable with the technique, you can increase the duration of your practice.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Remember, the key is to breathe slowly and deeply. If you feel lightheaded at any point, return to your normal breathing pattern.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Regular practice of diaphragmatic breathing can lead to long-term benefits, including improved emotional regulation, better stress management, and enhanced overall health. It&apos;s a simple yet powerful tool that you can use anywhere, at any time, to bring more calm and balance into your life.</p>
