        <div className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <p className="mb-3">Belly breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, is a fundamental yet powerful technique 
          that has been practiced for thousands of years in various cultures.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">This ancient practice of belly breathing has gained significant scientific backing in recent years, 
          as researchers continue to discover its profound effects on both physical and mental health.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">When you practice belly breathing, you engage the diaphragm &ndash; a dome-shaped muscle at the base 
          of your lungs &ndash; which is naturally designed to handle most of your breathing work.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">Modern life often leads to shallow, chest-based breathing patterns, which can contribute to 
          stress and anxiety.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">By returning to natural belly breathing patterns, we can activate our body's relaxation response 
          and improve our overall well-being.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">Regular belly breathing practice can transform your daily life, helping you manage stress more 
          effectively and maintain better health.</p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Find a comfortable position, either sitting with your spine straight or lying down on a flat surface. If sitting, keep your shoulders relaxed and head aligned with your spine.</li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your rib cage. This hand placement helps you become aware of your breathing pattern.</li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Begin your belly breathing practice by inhaling slowly through your nose, allowing your belly to expand like a balloon. The hand on your belly should rise, while the hand on your chest should remain relatively still.</li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling your belly fall. Imagine releasing all tension with each exhale. The hand on your belly should lower back to its starting position.</li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Maintain a steady rhythm with your belly breathing. Aim for a 4-second inhale and a 8-second exhale to start.</li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">Focus your attention on the rising and falling sensation in your belly, letting go of any distracting thoughts.</li>
